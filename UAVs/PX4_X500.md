# PX4 on X500 Setup

The following guide was created to setup a companion computer to integrate with the PX4 running on a X500 UAV

## [Setup/Installation] For interacting with PX4 V1.15 with ROS2 Jazzy on Ubuntu 24.04

The following steps can be used to setup a gazebo simulation of a PX4 X500 UAV with the following versions/software

- ROS Version: ROS2 Jazzy
- Ubuntu Version: Ubuntu 24.04
- Computer: Intel NUC-13
- PX4 Version: V1.14.3dev (should also work on V1.15)
- X500 Model: Pixhawk board: X500 v2 (Pixhawk 6X flight hardware)

### Preliminary Steps:
This guide assumes that the X500 has already been built, calibrated, configured and setup. The following document currently only shows you how to connect a companion computer to the PX4 via ROS2.

### 1. Install QGroundControl inorder to connect to and control UAV

Before setting up the PX4/ROS, QGroundControl must also be installed. Follow these steps to ensure that its installed correctly. To install it, please follow the steps on the [QGroundControl Download and Install instructions guide](https://docs.qgroundcontrol.com/master/en/qgc-user-guide/getting_started/download_and_install.html), and be sure to follow the instructions for "Ubuntu Linux".

### 2. Install ROS2 Jazzy
1. Install ROS2 Jazzy by following the instructions here: [ROS2 Jazzy Installation Guide](https://docs.ros.org/en/jazzy/Installation/Ubuntu-Install-Debs.html)
    - NOTE: If you are setting up ROS2 for your user acount on a machine that already has ROS2 installed on it, you should just be able to add the following command (or one similar to it) to your .bashrc file
    ```
    source /opt/ros/jazzy/setup.bash 
    ```
2. To enable connecting to the PX4 over ethernet using ROS2, the XRCE-DDS Client must be installed. To do so, follow the instructions for "Setup Micro XRCE-DDS Agent & Client" at the [PX4 ROS2 User Guide](https://docs.px4.io/v1.15/en/ros2/user_guide.html#setup-micro-xrce-dds-agent-client). Essentially the following commands will be executed:
    - Install the Micro-XRCE-DDS-Agent
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/eProsima/Micro-XRCE-DDS-Agent.git
    cd Micro-XRCE-DDS-Agent
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    make
    sudo make install
    sudo ldconfig /usr/local/lib/
    ```

3. Finally, in order to read/write PX4 message in ROS, the px4_ros_com and px4_msgs ROS2 packages must be included in ROS2 workspace's source directory (change ROS_PX4_2_WS to the desired ws)
    ```
    git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/cpsl-research/CPSL_ROS2_PX4.git
    ```

    If you forgot to clone the submodules as well, you can use the following command:
    ```
    git submodule update --init --recursive
    ```

    Once, cloned, the following commands can be used to build/install the necessary packages

    ```
    cd CPSL_ROS2_PX4
    rosdep install -i --from-path src --rosdistro jazzy -y
    colcon build --symlink-install
    source install/setup.bash
    ```

### 3.Install/Build the PX4 firmware (needed for a few tools)
Once ROS2, and QGroundControl are installed, we will then move to install the PX4 Source Code. While the following steps should help, helpful documentation can be found at [checkout release versions](https://docs.px4.io/v1.15/en/contribute/git_examples.html#get-a-specific-release) and [Ubuntu Setup](https://docs.px4.io/main/en/dev_setup/dev_env_linux_ubuntu.html). To do so, perform the following steps:
1. Clone the PX4 Source Code:
```
git clone https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot.git --recursive
```

2. Although not stated in the v1.15 guide, there should also be an Ubuntu setup script which can be used to make sure that all of the software is correctly setup for ubuntu. This can be run using the following command(as documented in [Ubuntu Setup (Main) guide](https://docs.px4.io/main/en/dev_setup/dev_env_linux_ubuntu.html)):
```
bash ./PX4-Autopilot/Tools/setup/ubuntu.sh --no-sim-tools
```

Note: the --no-sim-tools is used because we don't need gazebo in this case

### 4. Setup Ethernet on Nuc (Companion Computer)

**NOTE** Currently, the NUC13 cannot connect to the Pixhawk6x via ethernet on its own ethernet port. As such, you must use an ethernet adapter or ethernet switch to connect the Pixhawk6x to the NUC at this time. 

1. Go into your ethernet settings on the companion computer and setup the interface to have a static ip address of ```10.41.10.1``` with a subnet of ```255.255.255.0```. 

### 5. Setup Ethernet on PX4:
Several steps are needed to correctly setup ethernet on the PX4. Here, a helpful guide can be found at [PX4 Ethernet Network Setup](https://docs.px4.io/v1.15/en/advanced_config/ethernet_setup.html)

1. To start, we need to correctly set the ```net.cfg``` file on the Pixhawk's microSD card. To do so, eject the microSD card from the Pixhawk and open the files on another machine. Then, in the net.cfg file (create one if needed), add the following
```
DEVICE=eth0
BOOTPROTO=fallback
IPADDR=10.41.10.2
NETMASK=255.255.255.0
ROUTER=10.41.10.254
DNS=10.41.10.254
```
Once complete, put the SD card back into the Pixhawk and reboot the Pixhawk.

2. Once the PX4 has been rebooted, connect it to the companion computer via ethernet (in our case we power it using the NUC's USB cable as well). 

3. Open QGroundControl. If it doesn't automatically connect, try the following:
    
    - ensure that the serial ports are open/allowed by running the following command (make sure that PX4 is plugged in first)
    ```
    usermod -a -G dialout $USER
    chmod 666 /dev/ttyACM0
    ```
    - Setup Q ground control to look for an ethernet Comm link by following the (QGroundControl Ethernet Setup Example)[https://docs.px4.io/main/en/advanced_config/ethernet_setup.html#qgroundcontrol-setup-example] instructions.
4. Next, in QGround Control go to Q (top right corner) -> vehicle setup -> parameters to modify the following parameters:
    - ```UXRCE_DDS_CFG```: set to Ethernet (will require reboot to proceed with next steps)
    - ```UXRCE_DDS_PRT```: set to 8888 (unless changed to something else)
    - ```UXRCE_DDS_AG_IP```: set to 170461697 (corresponds to IP address of 10.41.10.1). See [starting the client](https://docs.px4.io/main/en/middleware/uxrce_dds.html#starting-the-client) instructions for further details
5. After this, you should just have to reboot the PX4 to have everything setup


## [Running] Connecting to the PX4 via ROS2

The following tutorials are useful for connecting to the PX4 with ROS2

### Initial connection/listing available topics
1. Reboot the PX4

2. Start the MicroXRCEAgent
```
MicroXRCEAgent udp4 -p 8888
```
3. Listen to ROS2 topics
```
cd CPSL_ROS2_PX4
source install/setup.bash
ros2 topic list
```
4. To see a sample ROS2 node, you can optionally run:
```
ros2 launch px4_ros_com sensor_combined_listener.launch.py
```
### 1. [DO NOT RUN/TO BE UPDATED] X500 with CPSL Sensors

1. Start QGroundControl

2. Start the MicroXRCEAgent to enable the ROS2 connection
    ```
    MicroXRCEAgent udp4 -p 8888
    ```
3. Finally, as an example of using ROS2, you can run the following ROS2 command to show an example of a launch file integration.
    ```
    ros2 run px4_ros_com offboard_control
    ```

## [Tutorials]

Below are several helpful tutorials to access data from a gazebo simulation in ROS

### 1. Keyop Control of X500
A good example/preview for how to control the PX4 using ROS2 can be found in the [ROS 2 Offboard Control Example](https://docs.px4.io/v1.15/en/ros2/offboard_control.html) page. A summary of the key steps is featured below as an example. Make sure that the ROS2 nodes have already been setup as stated above and the you have run ```colcon build``` on any packages you intend to use.
1. Start QGroundControl

2. Start the MicroXRCEAgent to enable the ROS2 connection
    ```
    MicroXRCEAgent udp4 -p 8888
    ```
3. Navigate to the CPSL_ROS2_PX4 ROS2 package folder
    ```
    cd CPSL_ROS2_PX4
    source install/setup.bash
    ros2 launch px4_controller keyop_control_launch.py
    ```
    The currently implemented keyop controls are as follows:
    - "a" - arm the UAV
    - "d" - disarm the UAV
    - "t" - takeoff
    - "l" - land
4. Next, use QGroundControl to put the PX4 into offboard control mode **FIX THIS ROS CODE ON THIS**
5. Finally, use the keyboard commands to arm, then takeoff
6. To land the UAV, press the "l" key and then "d" to disarm the UAV once it has landed.
